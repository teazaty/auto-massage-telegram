1. The script defines a function called sendTikTokVideoToTelegram that handles the process of sending the TikTok video link to the Telegram bot. This function uses the fetch function to make a POST request to the Telegram API's sendMessage endpoint.

2. Inside the sendTikTokVideoToTelegram function, the TikTok video URL is included in the request body along with the chat ID. The fetch function returns a promise, which is awaited to get the response from the API.

3. If the response from the Telegram API indicates a successful delivery (the ok property is true), a success message is printed to the console. If there is an error (the ok property is false), an error message with the description of the error is printed.

4. The script sets an interval using setInterval to repeatedly call the sendTikTokVideoToTelegram function at a specified delay. The delay is provided in seconds and converted to milliseconds (as expected by setInterval).

5. The script prints an initial message to the console to confirm that the script is running, including the specified delay.
